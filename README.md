Mesh-Networking-Chat-App
========================

This is my first side project from my time at Flatiron School.  The app was developed using multipeer connectivity incorporated into a chat messaging interface.

I'm using a modified version of BOR Chat (https://github.com/BohdanOrlov/BORChat) as the chat interface.  The multipeer connectivity framework can be found here (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/Introduction/Introduction.html).
